      <p>
        I'm a Web Developer located in Japan.
        I'm keen to develop software products that blend into people's daily lives and enrich them better.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I'm working as a developer, I'm also a student remotely majoring in Computer Science at University of London.

      <p>
        Curiosity is the source of my energy.
        I constantly get hooked on learning or playing something new, such as technology, game, sport, language, etc.
